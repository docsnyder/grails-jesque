Grails Jesque
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Grails-Plugin-Consortium/grails-jesque.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Grails-Plugin-Consortium/grails-jesque)

Jesque is an implementation of [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) in [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html).
It is fully-interoperable with the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) ([Coffee-Resque](https://github.com/technoweenie/coffee-resque)) implementations.

The grails jesque plugin uses [jesque](https://github.com/gresrun/jesque) and the grails redis plugin as a dependency.
While it uses jesque for the core functionality it makes it groovier to use in grails.

There is also a grails [jesque-web](https://github.com/michaelcameron/grails-jesque-web) plugin initially ported from the [jesque-web](https://github.com/gresrun/jesque-web) spring-mvc app, which itself was based on the Sinatra web app resque-web in [resque](https://github.com/resque/resque).
Either UI will allow you to see what's in your queues and view and re-process failed messages.

A scheduler (a la Quartz) has been added to support scheduled injection of jobs. The syntax is very similar to the grails Quartz plugin. 


Demo Project
-------------
There is a demo project located [in github](https://github.com/Grails-Plugin-Consortium/grails-jesque-demo).


How do I use it?
----------------
Add the jesque plugin to grails, it will automatically pull in jesque with it's dependencies, and the grails redis plugin.

```bash
dependencies {
    compile('org.grails.plugins:jesque:1.2.1')
}
```

You must also have [redis](http://redis.io) installed in your environment.


Example to enqueue

```groovy

class BackgroundJob {
    def someOtherService //auto-wiring supported

    def perform( arg1, arg2 ) {
        def domainObject = DomainClass.get(arg1) //GORM supported
        domainObject.message = arg2
        domainObject.save()
    }
}

class SomeOtherClass {
    def jesqueService

    def doWorkAsync() {
        jesqueService.enqueue( 'myQueueName', BackgroundJob.simpleName, 1, 'hi there')
    }

    def doWorkAsyncLater() {
        jesqueService.enqueueAt(System.currentTimeMillis() + (1000 * 60), 'myQueueName', BackgroundJob.simpleName, 1, 'hi there')
    }
}
```

Workers can be started manually by calling

```groovy
    jesqueService.startWorker( 'DemoJesqueJobQueue', DemoJesqueJob.simpleName, DemoJesqueJob )
```

or automatically upon start-up with the following config

```yaml
---
grails:
    redis:
        port: 6379
        host: localhost
    jesque:
        enabled: true
        failedItemLimit: 1000
        pruneOrphanedScheduledJobsOnStartup: true
        pruneWorkersOnStartup: true
        createWorkersOnStartup: true
        schedulerThreadActive: true
        startPaused: false
        autoFlush: true
        nextQueueStrategy: RESET_TO_HIGHEST_PRIORITY // or DRAIN_WHILE_MESSAGES_EXISTS
        workers:
            DemoJesqueJobPool:
                queueNames:
                    - "DemoQueue1"
                    - "DemoQueue2"
                jobTypes:
                    - org.grails.jesque.demo.DemoJesqueJob
                    - org.grails.jesque.demo.DemoTwoJesqueJob
```

The redis pool used is configured in the [redis](https://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-redis) plugin:

```yaml
grails:
    redis:
        host: localhost
        port: 6379
```

Or using sentinels

```yaml
grails:
    redis:
        sentinels:
            - 10.0.0.1:26379
            - 10.0.0.2:26379
        masterName: foobar        
```

Jobs
----
Jobs should be placed in grails-app/jobs similar to the [Quartz](http://grails.org/plugin/quartz) plugin.
However, to not clash with quartz, and to retain similarties with resque, the method to execute must be called perform.

You can run the script create-jesque-job to create a shell of a job for you automatically.  The
following will create a BackgroundJob in the grails-app/jobs folder.

```bash
grails create-jesque-job org.grails.jesque.demo.DemoJesqueJob
```

```groovy
package org.grails.jesque.demo

import groovy.util.logging.Slf4j

@Slf4j
class DemoJesqueJob {

    static queue = 'DemoJesqueJobQueue'
    static workerPool = 'DemoJesqueJobPool'

    static triggers = {
        cron name: 'DemoJesqueJobTrigger', cronExpression: '0/15 * * * * ? *'
    }

    def perform() {
        log.info "Executing Job"
    }
}
```

Custom Worker Listener
----
You can define one or more custom WorkerListener classes that will be automatically added to all workers started from within `jesqueService`.
You can implement the `GrailsApplicationAware` interface if you need access to the `grailsApplication` in your worker listener.

```groovy
grails {
    jesque {
        custom {
            listener.clazz = [LoggingWorkerListener] // accepts String, Class or List<String> or List<Class>
        }
    }
}
```
 
*All Listeners have to implement the WorkerListener Interface otherwise they will simply be ignored*

Roadmap
----
* Upgrade custom Listener and Worker to grails 3 support
* Ability to execute methods on services without creating a job object
* Wrap above ability automatically with annotation and dynamically creating a method with the same name + "Async" suffix
* Create grails/groovy docs (gdoc?) to extensively document options
* Dynamic wake time of delayed jobs thread to reduce polling
